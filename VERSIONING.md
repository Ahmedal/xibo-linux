We use semantic versioning with build number for this player.

The version from `--version` command line option should look like this: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH build: BUILD (e.g. `1.0.0 build: 10`, `0.2-alpha build: 25`, `0.3.1-alpha build: 3`)

Build number is the number of builds in current MINOR release. Alpha, beta and release candidates are marked with corresponding names (e.g. 0.2-alpha). Version without PATCH number corresponds to the version with PATCH = 0 (e.g. 0.2-alpha and 0.2.0-alpha are the same)

Each release is marked with color name (e.g. Aqua, Navy) to differentiate releases without mentioning numbers.
