We use semantic versioning with build number for this player.

The version from `--version` command line option should look like this: MAJOR.MINOR.PATH build: BUILD

Build number is the number of builds in current MINOR release. Alpha, beta and release candidates are marked with corresponding names (e.g. 0.2.0-alpha).
