### 0.4-alpha Viridian

- **User Part**
  - Scheduling system (with priorities, layout validation, date/time check **but without overlays**)
  - Collection interval that runs every specific period of time and collects information from CMS
    - NOTE: only 3 requests are implemented (Schedule, RegisterDisplay and RequiredFiles)

- **Developer Part**
  - Event System
  - Each media is a part of RegionContent class (with unit-tests) which is simplified media handling in Region
  - Async events use std::future instead of callbacks (except for boost::beast/asio low-level usage)
  - Refactored XMDS requests/responses
  - Builders were refactored
  - Files downloader was refactored
  - Logging instruction was simplified
  - Reduced compilation time

- **Not implemented/Notes**
  - Currently the player doesn't support local configuration settings
  - Default collection interval is 60 seconds to simplify testing
  - Only logLevel and collectionIntervalPeriod settings are updated during collection interval
  - MAC address is not generated by the player and defaulted to "test"
  - Schedule CMS time option is not handled (only local time) in the player
  - There is not file cache management for now 

- **Known bugs**
  - Video can sometimes stop unexpectedly and causes the schedule to broke (issue #139) 
  - Web View always uses `file://` scheme (in theory this can lead to weird bugs)
  - Closing app while downloading files leads to exception std::bad_alloc
  - Closing app while video/audio playing on the layout doesn't really terminate the app (event loop is still running)
  - File download doesn't have any timeout and tries to download endlessly
